# Doge-Bot
 
-This code is for an Discord bot, it requires for the user to have and mongoDB database already set up, as well as a discord bot token.

-This page will be updated as time goes by.

-Keep in mind that v1.2.4 is to be considered as version 1.0 as versions of the code previous to that one were lost, this first commit is just a proof of concept, an newer and improved version of the bot is in the works.

# -After completing the db.json file needed for the new feauture of the bot pushed v1.2.5, to my knowledge this has no bugs.

-Pushed an future release called v1.3.0 this is still in development and some feautures still have bugs, you might notice there are less files the point of this new version is to clean the code after gaining more knowledge about mongoDB.
