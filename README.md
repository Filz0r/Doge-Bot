# Doge-Bot
 
-This code is for an Discord bot, it requires for the user to have and mongoDB database already set up, as well as a discord bot token.

-This page will be updated as time goes by.

-Keep in mind that v1.2.4 is to be considered as version 1.0 as versions of the code previous to that one were lost, this first commit is just a proof of concept, an newer and improved version of the bot is in the works.
